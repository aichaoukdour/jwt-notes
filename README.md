** “A JSON Web Token (JWT), pronounced ‘jot’, is an open standard (RFC 7519) which is used for securely transmitting information between entities as a JSON object.” **

It is a compact and secure way of exchanging information over the network. JSON Web Token helps to maintain the integrity and authenticity of the information because it is digitally signed using secret or public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA.
